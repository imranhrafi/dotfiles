      You are updating a README.md for an existing project. Produce documentation that future LLMs can use to work accurately with this codebase without hallucinating.

      CONTEXT CHECKLIST (read these files first; cite facts only from them):
      - package.json — dependencies, scripts, metadata
      - tsconfig.json — TypeScript configuration
      - File structure — infer apps/packages layout from actual folders
      - Config files — build tooling, linting, monorepo tools (e.g., turbo.json)

      REQUIRED SECTIONS (include only what exists in the repo):

      1. Project Overview (2-3 sentences)
         - What the project does (derive from package.json description + folders)
         - Tech stack (from dependencies + config)
         - Target environment (browser/server/both)

      2. Quick Start (minimal viable)
         - Node/npm prerequisites (from engines if present)
         - Install command(s) only
         - Single dev run command only

      3. Project Structure (key items only)
         - apps/: list app names + 1-line purpose
         - packages/: list package names + 1-line purpose
         - Top-level: package.json, tsconfig.json, turbo.json — one sentence each

      4. Available Scripts (from package.json)
         - dev, build, lint, test (and important package-specific scripts only)

      5. Core Technologies
         - Framework, DB (if any), Auth/Config (if any), Deployment (from config)

      6. Development Notes (if applicable)
         - Required env vars
         - DB setup
         - Special local setup

      OUTPUT RULES (strict):
      - Evidence-based: do not invent files, commands, or tools; omit unknowns
      - Skip sections that cannot be supported by repository evidence
      - Use present tense and technical tone; no marketing language
      - Commands in fenced code blocks; everything else plain text
      - If information is ambiguous, state "Unknown" instead of guessing

  - trigger: ":rbc"
    replace: |
      READ BEFORE CODE
      Steps:
      - Open and read README.md, package.json, tsconfig.json, and repo structure.
      - Summarize project purpose, stack, and scripts in 5-7 bullet points.
      - List unknowns or missing info (if any) and assumptions you plan to make.
      - Confirm understanding with a one-paragraph plan.
      - Only then propose or write code changes.
