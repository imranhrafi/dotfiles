Fish Function Creation Prompt
Context
I'm using Fish shell and have a Git Function Power Pack. I need you to create a new Fish function that follows the same patterns and standards as my existing functions.
My Requirements
Function Standards:

Use Fish shell syntax
Include proper error handling and safety checks
Add helpful feedback messages with emojis
Follow the naming pattern: git-action for git functions, or function-name for general functions
Include input validation with clear usage examples
Add confirmation prompts for destructive operations
Use consistent emoji patterns (‚úÖ for success, ‚ùå for errors, üí° for hints, etc.)

Safety Features I Want:

Check if we're in appropriate context (git repo, valid directory, etc.)
Prevent accidental data loss
Provide clear error messages that tell me what went wrong AND how to fix it
Add confirmation prompts for dangerous operations

Code Style:

Use helper functions for common checks (like _git_check)
Keep functions focused on one task
Use meaningful variable names
Include comments for complex logic
Follow the existing patterns from my Git Power Pack

What I Need From You
Please create a Fish function that:

Follows my existing patterns - Use the same style, error handling, and feedback as my Git functions
Includes proper documentation - Show usage examples and explain when to use it
Has safety features - Appropriate checks and confirmations
Provides clear feedback - Success/error messages with emojis
Integrates well - Can be added to my existing function collection
